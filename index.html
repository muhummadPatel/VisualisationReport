            We found the topic of the evolution of world religions over time to be a very intriguing topic and one worthy of further investigation. We found a very large dataset showing a breakdown of the number of followers of the major religions in each country every 5 years from 1945 to 2010. Furthermore, it showed the populations of each sect within the various religions. The dataset was in the form of a very large spreadsheet (available as a csv file or an Excel workbook). This format was extremely difficult to interrogate meaningfully, especially due to the high dimensionality of the data.

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>
            The dataset presented an interesting visualisation challenge due to the different types of dimensions that needed to be represented, viz.: geographical(country), quantitative(population/number of followers), nested categorical(religion, and religious sect), and temporal(year). We realised that this detailed data would allow for rich analysis if presented in a coherent manner that would allow us to exploit the strong pattern recognition abilities of the visual system.

            In order to guide the design of our visualisation, we identified the following as the most important visual queries to be supported (ranked in descending order):
            <ul>
              <li>What is the most popular religion in the world at a particular time?</li>
              <li>How does the religious composition between two countries differ?</li>
              <li>How has a particular religion risen/declined over time?</li>
              <li>In a particular country, what is the dominant religion?</li>
              <li>What is the breakdown of a particular religion wrt. the sects of that religion?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            These visual queries were the questions that we most strongly wanted to answer with our visualisation. Between each design iteration, we tried to evaluate the effectiveness of our design by referring back to these visual queries and assessing the ease with which they could be answered.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>
            Interestingly, during the design process, we found that we needed to re-evaluate and edit our visual queries with each iteration of our design. This was because with each iteration we found that some queries were not as important/interesting/revealing as we initially thought they would be. Additionally, during the design process, we uncovered some new queries that opened up novel ways of interacting with the data. For example, our initial list of visual queries did not include the comparison between the religious composition of two countries. This query was added after the first feedback session when it was identified as a point of interest by a member of the audience.

          <p>
            Our final visualisation design, like all good designs, is the product of multiple iterations and many failures. Once we had identified our topic and procured our dataset, we engaged in multiple brainstorming sessions and kept track of our best ideas. This collection of ideas was then used to generate our first design iteration.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our first design iteration presented the data as a collection of connected visualisations. We attempted to show the user as much about the data as possible on a single page while still allowing the user to interrogate the data further through interaction.
          </p>

          <h4>Legend</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-4">
          <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="img/oldlegend.jpg" alt="img/oldlegend.jpg"><br/><br/>
          </div>
          <p>
            The legend used coloured symbols to show the viewer the religions being displayed on the map. We used symbols to allow for faster recognition of the religion and used colour as a second channel to differentiate between the different religions/categories in our data. To account for the fact that some users may not recognise some of the religion symbols, we also included the name of the religion as text next to the coloured symbols of the legend.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>
            One of the key weaknesses of this legend was that it did not differentiate, or even acknowledge, the existence of the various religious sects. For example, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all have multiple sects that form part of the religion. These sects, while present in the bar graph, were not being displayed in the legend and this proved to be a source of confusion for some of the viewers in the feedback session.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another weakness of this design was the colour scheme, which used colours that were much too intense for use on the other visualisations. When used on the map, the intense colours were quite painful. We realised that the colours needed to be less intense, especially for the larger religions, like Christianity and Islam.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of symbol and colour to differentiate between the religions (2 feature channels) was a good design element that we decided to keep.

          </div>
          <p>
            The line graph provided the viewer with an overview of the trends in each religion over time. This allowed the user to see, in a single view, how each religion had risen/declined through all the years present in our dataset. The colours used for the year in the line graph were consistent with the colouring of the symbols in the legend. This colouring was kept consistent throughout the design to aid learnability.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>
            The line graph also served as an interactive timeline. A slider (using familiar UI components) was placed below the line graph and a tracking line (inspired by the selector on old analog FM radios) connected the slider handle to the years in the line graph. The slider would allow the user to interact with the data to adjust the map and bar graph to show the data for a particular year. In this way, the user could inspect trends through the line graph and drill into the data further using the map and bar graph elements. We used bright pink for the tracking line to make it stand out from the lines for religions and made it transparent to further indicate that it was a background element and not a data series. In order to view data for a different year, the user would use the slider to change to a different year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, the fact that we did not use real data for this mockup was a key weakness here. Furthermore, the years on the x-axis did not reflect the full range of our data.

          <p>
            We used a map of the world with each country coloured in according to the dominant religion in that country at that time. This allowed the user to see the geographic spread of religion at a particular time. The colouring of the map also provided an indication as to which religion was the most popular religion in the world at that time. Note that the colouring used in the map is also consistent with the legend and line graph.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>
            The map also allowed for user interaction and served a secondary function as a selector. Once a user selected a country, all other graphs would change to display only the data pertaining to the selected country. This allowed the user to drill down and interrogate the data as they wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            We did not account for comparisons in this design and this was identified as an important feature to be added in the next design iteration. Furthermore, the colours used in this design were much too intense, and this is most visible in the map. We see large expanses of the map coloured in an extremely intense blue. The high intensity of all the colours was visually disturbing and this needed to be fixed in the next iteration. Another weakness of this map was that it did not indicate the dominant religious sect even though this data was available in our dataset.

          <p>
            A stacked bar graph allowed the user to get the specific number of followers of each religion. We used the stacked bar graph format so that the sects of the religions could also be displayed on the same graph. Each sect was represented as a section on the bar of the religion to which that sect belonged. The x-axis of the graph used coloured symbols, consistent with the symbols from the legend, to differentiate between the different religions being displayed. This use of symbols was an effective design element. In terms of space usage, the bars were kept separated to convey that that they were different, unconnected categories.

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>
             In this design, the user was required to hover over a division of the bar to see which sect that division represented and this was a major shortcoming of this design. Because we did not use real data in this mockup, we did not encounter the problem of extreme data ranges which we had to address in our next iteration. Another shortcoming of this design was the fact that the different sects within religions were not differentiated at all; they were the same colour and the only indication that they were different sects was the separators on the bar.

            This first design iteration was presented to the class for feedback and critique. We received much constructive criticism and feedback on our initial design. The following are some of the key criticisms we received from the class feedback session:
            <ul>
             <li>Improve line graphs</li>
             <li>Allow for comparisons between countries</li>
             <li>Allow viewer to explore different sects of a religion</li>
             <li>Use different intensities of colour for sects</li>
             <li>Improve the colour scheme (use lower intensity colours for large areas)</li>
             <li>Use texture and depth</li>

            Additionally, in a retrospective meeting following the presentation, we identified the following issues as key weaknesses of our design process to address in the next iteration:
            <ul>
              <li>We were not using real data in our design mockups. This made it extremely difficult to assess the effectiveness of our design</li>
              <li>We had not formally specified the interaction that we had discussed and as such it was difficult to communicate and reason about the design effectively<li>
