            One of the main strengths of our final design is the easily accessible overview of the data. Our use of a dashboard allows the user to see multiple views of the data at the same time. The map shows the dominant religion in the countries of the world at a specific time and the line graph shows the trends through time. The user is thus able to, at the same time, see both the state of world religion at a specific point in time (from the map) and how that state fits into the general trend of world religion (from the line graph and timeline slider).
          </p>
          <p>
            Our design also allows for easy comparison between religions in specific countries (by selecting countries from the map) and comparisons between the different religions (by filtering out religions from the bar and line graphs using the legend). Furthermore, our visualisation also allows for easy comparison between the different sects of a religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The consistent use of colour and symbols throughout our design allows for learnability of the concept. Although we classify this as a strength of our design, we do concede that the large number of religions being displayed may serve as a weak point in our design. Viewers may get confused by the large number of religions in the visualisation. Also, due to the extensive use of colour, our visualisation may not be suitable for colour-blind viewers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>
            Another weakness of our design is the difficulty in comparing the exact number of followers of religions across years. This is because the bar graph and map only show the data for a single year and the line graph is very visually busy. By allowing users to filter out religions from the line and bar graphs using the legend, we were able to reduce the number of lines on the line graph, but this is only a partial solution. A better solution may have been to introduce a new filter to allow the user to compare the followers of religions between 2 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another possible shortcoming of our design is the fact that it may not work very well on smaller screens. When the user selects countries, the bar graph updates to compare the two countries. Unfortunately, on smaller screens, the bar graph is off screen and the user may not see this update happening. Even when it is on screen, it is in the periphery of the userâ€™s vision. This change may go unnoticed if the user is not specifically looking for it (change blindness). This is another issue that could be addressed in future iterations of this design.
