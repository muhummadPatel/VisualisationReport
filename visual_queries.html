            In order to guide the design of our visualisation, we identified the following as the most important visual queries to be supported (ranked in descending order):
            <ul>
              <li>What is the most popular religion in the world at a particular time?</li>
              <li>How does the religious composition between two countries differ?</li>
              <li>How has a particular religion risen/declined over time?</li>
              <li>In a particular country, what is the dominant religion? </li>
              <li>What is the breakdown of a particular religion wrt. the sects of that religion?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            These visual queries were the questions that we most strongly wanted to answer with our visualisation. Between each design iteration, we tried to evaluate the effectiveness of our design by referring back to these visual queries and assessing the ease with which they could be answered.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <p>
            Interestingly, during the design process, we found that we needed to re-evaluate and edit our visual queries with each iteration of our design. This was because with each iteration, we found that some queries were not as important, interesting or revealing as we initially thought they would be. Additionally, during the design process, we uncovered some new queries that opened up novel ways of interacting with the data. For example, our initial list of visual queries did not include the comparison between the religious composition of two countries. This query was added after the first feedback session when it was identified as a point of interest by a member of the audience.
