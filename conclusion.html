            After multiple iterations of the design, we have been able to address some of our visual queries that were highlighted while others only partially. We felt that using a map with a number of other charts would be the most effective way to communicate a lot of data, without overwhelming the reader.
          </p>
          <p>
            With regards to the main visual queries, users are able to identify the main religion in countries easily as well compare the composition of religions between two countries. Users can also interrogate the sects of particular religions as well as and identify the rise and decline of religion over time. On the other hand, users cannot easily identify how the different sects have risen and declined over time. There is also nothing that provides a general overview of how the main religion of a country has changed as users have to manually click between each year to do this. It was, however, part of our design decisions to keep the visualization focussed on a specific area and limit the number of the pivots the user can filter on to reduce cognitive load.

            Our design only serves as a mockup for a visualization that could be fully implemented. Our data spans from 1945 - 2010 but we do not have information for all of the regions. Since there are many religions being displayed, a potential improvement could be to include more information about the religions itself. This could be incorporated through a simple hover-over or a separate body of text.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, while there is still room for much improvement, we feel that we have successfully been able to answer most of our visual queries and communicate the data in an effective and understandable way to produce a visualization that is informative and useful.
